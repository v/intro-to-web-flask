HTML - Language of the web

When I go to google.com - there's a client server architecture going on.

HTML is an XML format
    - It's got "tags".
    - <html> is an opening tag for the "html" element.
    - <title> is an opening tag.
    - </title> is a closing tag.
    - <h1> stands for header 1 - the biggest possible header.
    - whitespace does not matter.
    - <br> makes a line break.

Tags can have attributes
    - a tag is a link tag. href attribute - Hyperlink reference

HTML is a "Markup Language" - It deals with the presentation of content, and not with programming logic.

Every program in the world has to take in input and give you output.

HTML is not a programming language.

forms and input.
    - The web is powered by forms and input.
    - when you "submit a form", your URL changes:
        * ?name=V&lunch=pizza
        * ?name=Billy&lunch=burrito
        * ?first_name=billy&lunch=pizza

You need a programming language to do something with this input. We're going to use Python / Flask.

what is Flask
    - Flask is "Web server"
    - Web is a client server architecture
        * When I go to Google, my browser sends a "request" to Google, and gets back a "response".
        * Flask is now the "server" my browser is talking to.
    - What Flask is returning is just HTML.
    - You can render_templates in Flask to spit out HTML files (remember to create a templates/ folder).

Notice that when I submit the form. The "parameters" are in the URL.

When you submit a form using POST, the "parameters" are not in URL. They are "hidden" in HTTP Request.

You use POST to submit a form
    - When you have things that would look bad in the URL.
    - When you don't want people to be able to visit the page just by visiting the URL.
    - Things that "change state" should be used with POST.
    - GET is used for "information retrieval".

HTTPS
    - means that your Request and Response to the server is encrypted.

Certificate for HTTPS - Verisign

v.com

Action is where the data for this form should be submitted.
